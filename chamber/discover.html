            <h1>Temple Groundbreaking</h1>
            <p>A groundbreaking and site dedication ceremony was held on Saturday, 12 June 2021, for the Syracuse Utah Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Elder Kevin R. Duncan, a General Authority Seventy and executive director of the Church’s Temple Department, presided at the event. He offered an address and a dedicatory prayer on the property, the construction process, and the preparation of local Latter-day Saints to attend and work in the temple following its completion.</p>

            <h1>What's the building scoop?</h1>
            <p>
                A major revitalization project is underway at Stoker Park. Located at 1575 S 1150 W, this 6.5 acre park is receiving exciting upgrades to make it a fun and engaging recreational space for all members of our community. Popular features in the upgrade plan include tennis courts, volleyball courts, and open recreational space. A new restroom has been added and a large pavilion will be constructed. The irrigation system and landscaping are also being upgraded for efficiency and sustainability. The work is on track to be finished in the spring.

            <h1>Secondary Water</h1>
            <p>Secondary water will be shut off October 1st, 2023.  Pressures will begin to drop September 29th and 30th as the system drains. Protect your sprinkler system during the winter months by winterizing your system. We live in a climate that has freezing temperatures in the winter months that can burst pipes and valves that are not drained.</p>
